full functioning calculator

here is how my calculator is functioning

   i have hard coded the screen and divided it into 2 parts
        (i). The first part of the screen is has a class of current which takes the value of each number buttons when clicked
        (ii). the second part of the screen takes the value of the current screen when you click the operation buttons
1. click the numbers and there values will be written on the current screen
2. if you click the operation button, both the value on the current screen plus the uperation value will be written on the upper screen
3. if  the upper screen has values the program takes both the current screen value and the upper screen value evaluates the value and prints the results
4. if you click full stop button cant be clicked twice
